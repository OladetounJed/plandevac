noisy javascript code: arrow functions 
let take for example an array with list of jobs 
we can have our function as 
   const activeJobs = jobs.filter(function(job) {
        return job.isActive;
      });
but using javacript arrow function we have 
const activeJobs = jobs.filter(job => job.isActive);

the only difference is arrow functions dont rebind this.
